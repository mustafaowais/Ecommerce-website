            <h1>Terms and Condition</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="terms">
            The following General Terms and Conditions of Sale govern the sale of merchandise by YNAP Corporation, an
            affiliate of YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A. (the "Provider" or "we") to you through the PS section of
            www.Brand4u.com ("PK Site"). The PK Site is available only for purchases made and delivered within the
            Pakistan.
            Your use of the PK Site to purchase merchandise indicates your agreement to follow and to be bound
            by these General Terms and Conditions of Sale.
        </div>
        <div class="term">
            <h5 class="h6">(i)Orders & Products</h5>
            All orders are subject to email confirmation by us. Please note that the products displayed on the PK Site
            may be out-of-stock or discontinued, and availability is not guaranteed. Please note that while we have
            tried to accurately display the colours of products, the actual colours you see will depend on your monitor
            and may not be accurate.
            <h5 class="h6">(ii)Prices</h5>
            All prices are in PK Rupees. Prices may change without notice from time to time. The total amount due is
            inclusive of sales tax applied in accordance with applicable state and local regulations based on your
            shipping address. The applicable sales tax amount is indicated on the payment page of the cart.
            <br><br>
            The amount of sales tax charged on your order will depend upon various factors, including type of item
            purchased, sales price and destination of the shipment. Sales tax regulations may change between the time
            you place an order and the time of credit card charge authorisation and this may affect the calculation of
            sales taxes. The amount appearing on your payment page of the cart may differ from the sales taxes
            ultimately charged as indicated in the invoice you will receive with the shipping confirmation email.
            <br><br>
            All prices are inclusive of customs and import duties.

            <h5 class="h6">(iii)Shipping Cost</h5>
            You are responsible for the shipping costs associated with the delivery of the products you purchase on the
            PK Site as specified on your order confirmation.

            <h5 class="h6">(iv)Shipments & Delivery</h5>
            You can choose to receive the products you have purchased at your chosen address or at a Chloé point of sale
            in your country of purchase, selected from those listed on the order form. If you have chosen delivery to a
            point of sale, we will inform you of the products’ arrival at the store by email. In this case, you must
            collect the purchased products from the chosen point of sale no later than 10 working days after the
            aforementioned email is sent. Should you fail to collect the products within the aforementioned period of 10
            working days, the purchase shall be understood, to all intents and purposes, to be automatically terminated.
            Consequently, it will no longer be possible to collect the products, which will be returned to the Provider
            by the personnel of the chosen point of sale. As a result of the termination of the contract of purchase of
            the products, you will be reimbursed the sums paid, within the time frame set forth in our Return and Refund
            Policy. When you go to the point of sale to collect the order, you must show the sales assistant a copy of
            the delivery confirmation email, as well as a personal identification document. If you ask another person to
            collect the order, he/she will need to present the delivery confirmation email, a photocopy of your
            identification document, a document in which you authorize him/her to collect the order, and his/her own
            identification document. We would like to remind you that you cannot pay for the items at the point of sale,
            which means that you cannot select the cash-on-delivery option if you choose delivery to a point of sale. If
            you have selected delivery to a point of sale, the delivery timings and costs are the same as those for
            delivery to your chosen address. In any case, you bear all risks of loss and damage to the products from the
            time the same have cleared our fulfillment house. Delivery is deemed complete and title to the products
            passes to you upon acceptance of shipment by a common carrier.

            <h5 class="h6">(v)Returns & Refunds</h5>
            Please refer to our Return and Refund Policy, which forms an integral part of these General Terms and
            Conditions of Sale. In certain circumstances detailed in our Return Policy, you shall be entitled to
            exchange your product for a different size or colour of the same product type provided they are of
            equivalent value.

            <h5 class="h6">(vi)Binding Agreements</h5>
            Our order confirmation, these General Terms and Conditions of Sale and our other Site Policies shall be
            deemed the final and integrated agreement between you and us on the matters contained in these General Terms
            and Conditions of Sale.

            <h5 class="h6">(vii)Declaimers & Limitations Of Liability</h5>

            LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT, AND

            CONTAINED ON OUR ORDER CONFIRMATION. THE PROVIDER WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING
            FROM THE USE OF THE PK SITE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE AND
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
            CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN
            DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY
            NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.

            <h5 class="h6">(viii)Serverability</h5>
            If any provision of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale is determined to be invalid, illegal or
            unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale remain in full force
            to the extent permitted by law.

            <h5 class="h6">(ix)Privacy</h5>

            not possible to ensure that any website is completely free of human or technological errors. This website
