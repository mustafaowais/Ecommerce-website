                Like most Platforms, Brand 4 ué logs IP addresses and uses cookies and similar technologies that allow

                recognise you and to customise your experience, and provide us with information about the way our

                Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your computer or
                mobile device when you visit a website or mobile application. They are used to recognise your computer
                as you move between pages on a website, or when you return to a website or mobile application you have
                visited previously. Cookies are widely used in order to make platforms work, or to work more
                efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the platform.<br><br>

                We use cookies to enhance the online experience of our visitors (for example, by remembering your
                language and/or product preferences) and to better understand how our Platform is used. Cookies may tell
                us, for example, whether you have visited our Platform before or whether you are a new visitor. They can
                also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.<br><br>


                There are two broad categories of cookies:<br><br>

                <li><strong> first party cookies, </strong>served directly by Brand 4 ué to your computer or mobile
                    device.
                    They are used only by
                    Brand 4 u to recognise your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Platform.<br><br></li>
                <li> <strong> third party cookies,</strong> which are served by a third party service provider on our
                    Platform, and can be used
                    by the service provider to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other platforms.
                    Third party cookies are most commonly used for platform analytics or advertising purposes.</li>
                <br><br><br>
                Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Brand 4 u uses both
                'session cookies' and 'permanent cookies'. Session cookies exist only while your browser is open and are
                deleted automatically once you close your browser. Permanent cookies survive after your browser is
                closed, and can be used to recognise your computer or mobile device when you open your browser and
                browse the internet again.
